# Crop-by-Template
This project searches for a specific form template within an image using template matching techniques and automatically crops the image based on the matched region. It is useful for pre-processing scanned documents, forms, or surveys by isolating the relevant form area for further analysis or storage.
I have attached the original images of the form where the template appears to be at different locations along with the template image that needs to matched and cropped form original images.
